# Java Challengers

This repository contains a collection of **real-world Java programming challenges** written by [**RafaeldelNero**](https://www.infoworld.com/profile/rafael-del-nero/), the creator of **JavaChallengers** and a recognized **JavaChampion**.

Each challenge demonstrates a key Java concept — from generics and pattern matching to concurrency and type systems — explained through concise, executable examples.  
They are designed to help developers understand the JVM deeply and reason about Java like professional engineers.
